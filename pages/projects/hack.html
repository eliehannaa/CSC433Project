      <p>
        I wrote a Python script that takes a URL as its first argument and
        performs some operations on it. The script uses the requests library to
        retrieve the HTML content of the URL and then uses regular expressions
        to extract various information from it. Specifically, the script
        extracts all of the URLs contained in the HTML and writes them to a file
        called files_output.bat. Additionally, the script reads two input files
        called dirs_dictionary.bat and subdomains_dictionary.bat that contain
        lists of directories and subdomains to try, respectively. For each
        directory and subdomain, the script constructs a full URL by appending
        it to the original URL and then sends a GET request to that URL. If the
        request succeeds (i.e., returns a status code between 200 and 299), the
        script writes the URL to either directories_output.bat or
        subdomains_output.bat, depending on whether it was a directory or
        subdomain that was tried.
