        Quicksort, a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency, can
        also benefit from parallelization. The key idea is to partition the
        array into subarrays, each handled independently by different processing
        units. Concurrently applying the quicksort algorithm to these subarrays
        allows for parallel execution, leading to a more rapid sorting process.
        However, careful consideration must be given to load balancing and
        synchronization to optimize performance and ensure accurate sorting.
